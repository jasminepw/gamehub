            <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
            <p>
                Our topic is gaming, but our intended audience will range from beginner to novice players. This site will allow users who are new to the community to discover games that can help them get started and veteran gamers to find new games they have not played yet.
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem space that we are hoping to address are the limited resources available to introduce non-gamers to a relatively exclusive space. In addition, introducing the resources that can help increase exposure to smaller, newer video game creators and lesser-known games.
            </p>
            <p>
                There have been some indirect attempts in order to address our problem. An attempt at the problem is <a href="https://gameslikefinder.com/">gameslikefinder.com</a> which suggests games based on games that you already play. In addition, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a> has features implemented that would allow you to find new games based on a recommendation list. Although both solutions have some features that address our problems such as a search for new games and recommendations, there is no way to introduce new to novice gamers into the relatively exclusive gaming community.

<!-- Requirements -->

<!-- 2. A <header> containing a title for your page as a top-level heading (<h1>). -->

<!-- 3. Different <section> elements for each major part of your page (e.g., Problem Description, Proposed Application). Note that a functionality walkthrough would be appropriate as a "subsection" (e.g., a <section> within a <section>). -->

<!-- 4. Use appropriate HTML elements to semantically organize the content. For example, you might describe the different interactions a user can perform using an unordered list. -->

<!-- 5. Include hyperlinks to at least two (2) outside resources, references, or data sets related to your topic. These can be links to other applications in the same problem space. If you'll be using an existing data set, be sure to link to that! -->

<!-- 6. CSS: Include at least two (2) rules that change at least three (3) different properties total.

Adding some spacing around the content is a great use of CSS. -->
